## Questions

###1. Swift is a work-in-progress language; how do you stay informed and connected to the community?
I started off learning Swift with the book 'Swift Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide' and I use it to review from time to time. I try to stay up to date by subscribing to blogs like NSHipster. And I've joined the Swift iOS Development group on facebook to stay connected to the community.
###3. What is your favorite open source Swift library?
I've used Alamofire in all the iOS projects I've worked on thus far. It simplifies making requests and handling responses. I also use the AlamofireImage component library to deal with asynchronous network downloading of images.
###4. Do you usually build interfaces in code or with interface builder?
My coding style in Xcode has been a hybrid. I stick with the interface builder for basic styles. I find it to be cleaner because there's less code and the components are reusable. It's also nice that it catches and gives more insight to runtime errors and doesn't break when I'm updating to the newest version of Xcode. When necessary, for more dynamic content or interactive UIs, I build out the components in code. Because the NBC application is the base of other brands under the NBC Universal umbrella, we've created a themable UI styles and copy in code. In all cases, I make it a point to confer and determine what works best for the project at hand with the team to build the project out adhering to the same coding styles.
